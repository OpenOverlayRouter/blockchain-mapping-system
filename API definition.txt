signer get_next_signer()
#returns the next IP that has to sign a block

calculate_next_signer(myIPs ip)
#calculates the next IP that will sign a block. It is stored in an internal variable that get_next_signer() uses
#myIPs is the set of IPs owned by the node, updated each time a block is added
#if myIPs is None, means that it the previous block was incorrect

#returns a sign object that says if the node has to sign
